# Big Data Job Analysis

### Project Overview

This project analyzes online job postings to find the most in-demand Big Data technologies and skills. Using a Kaggle dataset, it identifies popular job roles, top hiring locations, and trending tools like Hadoop, Spark, and Hive. The goal is to help HR professionals and job seekers understand current job market trends in the Big Data field.

### Key Highlights

1. Analyzes real-world job posting data from Kaggle
2. Identifies high-demand Big Data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, etc.)
3. Visualizes top job roles, hiring locations, and company ratings
4. Generates word clouds to highlight frequently mentioned job skills
5. Provides insights to help HR teams design better job descriptions

### Tools & Technologies

- Language : Python(Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries : Pandas, NumPy – Data analysis and processing and Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud – Data visualization
- Dataset source : Kaggle Dataset
- IDE : Jupyter Notebook


### Project Workflow

1. Data Import and Cleaning – Load the Kaggle dataset and handle missing or irrelevant data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyze job categories, ratings, and locations.
3. Big Data Technology Filtering – Identify jobs mentioning Big Data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, and Hive.
4. Visualization – Plot graphs for top roles, technologies, and locations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. Word Cloud Generation – Highlight frequently mentioned keywords in job descriptions.


### Key Insights 

1. Data Analyst roles are among the most frequently posted jobs.
2. Hadoop, Spark, and Hive are the top-demanded Big Data technologies.
3. Major tech hubs show the highest number of Big Data job postings.
4. Word Cloud results confirm recurring skills such as Data Analyst, Big Data, and Analysis.


### Conclusion

This project provides a clear, data-driven overview of the Big Data job market, helping HR professionals, recruiters, and job seekers identify in-demand technologies and roles. It bridges the gap between industry needs and talent awareness in the growing Big Data ecosystem.
